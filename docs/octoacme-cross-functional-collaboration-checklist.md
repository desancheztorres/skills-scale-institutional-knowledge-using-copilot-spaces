## Communication Best Practices

### For Effective Cross-Functional Collaboration:

**Be Proactive**

- Surface risks and blockers as soon as they're identified
- Ask questions early rather than making assumptions

**Be Clear on Ownership**
- Know who is Accountable vs. Responsible for each activity
- Clarify decision-making authority upfront
- Document decisions and communicate to all Informed parties

**Respect Expertise**
- Trust each role's domain knowledge and recommendations
- Seek input from relevant roles before making decisions
- Acknowledge contributions and expertise across the team

**Maintain Transparency**
- Keep project boards and documentation up to date
- Share progress and setbacks openly in team forums
- Make information accessible to all who need it

**Foster Psychological Safety**
- Encourage questions and healthy debate
- Accept failures as learning opportunities
- Celebrate team wins, not just individual achievements

---

## Collaboration Health Check

Review these indicators monthly to assess collaboration effectiveness:

**Green Indicators (Strong Collaboration)**
- Decisions made quickly with appropriate input from all roles
- Blockers resolved within one business day on average
- Cross-functional meetings have high attendance and engagement
- Team members proactively reach out to other roles for input
- Retrospectives identify concrete collaboration improvements

**Yellow Indicators (Collaboration Needs Attention)**
- Repeated escalations due to unclear ownership
- Rework caused by lack of early collaboration
- Some roles feel excluded from key decisions
- Communication gaps lead to surprises
- Action items from retrospectives not consistently completed

**Red Indicators (Collaboration Breakdown)**
- Frequent conflicts between roles on priorities or approach
- High-severity incidents caused by lack of coordination
- Teams working in silos with minimal cross-functional interaction
- Stakeholders regularly caught off-guard by project status
- Turnover or burnout in key roles

If you identify yellow or red indicators, use this checklist to diagnose gaps and create targeted improvement actions.
